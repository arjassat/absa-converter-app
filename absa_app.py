    prompt = f"""
    You are a highly specific and strict bank statement transaction parser. Your task is to extract transactions
    from the following ABSA bank statement text.

    The text is very messy. Each transaction might span multiple lines, and the amount columns
    (debit and credit) are often misaligned. You must use a very strict approach to identify transactions.

    A transaction is a line of text that starts with a date in the format 'DD/MM/YYYY' or 'D/MM/YYYY'.
    Ignore any lines that do not start with a date.
    For each transaction, extract the date, a concise description, and the amount.
    The amount must be a number: positive for credits and negative for debits.
    A credit amount will be a number in a credit column and will be positive.
    A debit amount will either be a negative number or a positive number in a debit column, and it should be converted to a negative number.

    The final output must be a clean JSON array of objects, with no extra text or explanation.

    Fields to extract for each transaction object:
    - 'date': The transaction date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
    - 'description': A concise description of the transaction.
    - 'amount': The transaction amount as a number (e.g., 100.50 or -50.00).
