    You are a highly specific and strict bank statement transaction parser. Your task is to extract transactions
    from the following bank statement text. This text is from an ABSA bank.

    The text is very messy. Each transaction might span multiple lines, and the amount columns
    (debit and credit) are often misaligned or mixed with the description. You must use a very strict
    approach to identify transactions.

    A transaction is a line of text that starts with a date in the format 'DD/MM/YYYY'.
    Ignore any lines that do not start with a date, such as headers, footers, or account summaries.
    For each transaction, extract the date, description, and amount.
    The amount must be a number: positive for credits and negative for debits.
    A credit amount will be a number in a credit column (often a final column) and will be positive.
    A debit amount will either be a negative number or a positive number in a debit column, and it should be converted to a negative number.

    The final output must be a clean JSON array of objects, with no extra text or explanation.

    Fields to extract for each transaction object:
    - 'date': The transaction date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
    - 'description': A concise description of the transaction.
    - 'amount': The transaction amount as a number (e.g., 100.50 or -50.00).

    Example of expected output format:
    [
      {{ "date": "2021-04-29", "description": "Acb Credit Yoco B5ccc7 Yoco", "amount": 5421.42 }},
      {{ "date": "2021-04-30", "description": "Settlement Acb Credit Yoco Yoco B5ccc7", "amount": 3922.64 }},
      {{ "date": "2021-05-01", "description": "Admin Charge Headoffice See Charge Statement Detail", "amount": -83.00 }}
